Introduction to github

Hi to whomever is reading this!

My name is Jose, and I'm new to this. I'm currently a Master of Science in Applied Statistis candidate at Fordham University. I'm learning a lot about dealing with data and a good portion of that involves programming. I hope to get a job as a Data Analyst in the tech industry or as a Quantitative Analyst in the finance industry. I decided to give github a try in order to document and display my trials and tribulations on my path to achieve my goal. So sit back and relax. Hope you enjoy!

Thanks for reading!


Regards,

Jose M.
